**Blind8** is a dating app built with user authentication, profile creation, search, and messaging features using Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. 

As a user, you are able to create a profile however you are not allowed to upload a photo of yourself. You can then search other users (limited to 8) and poke them to begin a chat. An icebreaker question is automatically generated for users to ease into a meaningful conversation with other users and prevent "stale" dating app conversations.
